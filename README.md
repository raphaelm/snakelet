Snakelet
--------

This is a minimal snake game that can be embeded into any web page as simple as:

    <script src="snake.js"></script>

It will render a 5px-large snake and a 5px-large target somewhere on the page.
Currently, there aren't many configuration options. I'd accept pull requests to
make colors, sizes configurable.

Touch screen controls are supported and the game state is stored in the browser's session storage such that it survives refreshing the page.
